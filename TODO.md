# Things I want to improve on the code base

## Now
- [ ] Exploring inlining of the currently sourced lib files to make it one single file stored in ~/.local/bin

## Next
- [ ] Allow for optional arguments for export mode and number of records to export
- [ ] Refactor to allow for a bit more configuration (e.g., of the files)

## Later
